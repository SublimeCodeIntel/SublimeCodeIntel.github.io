title: Quick-start
---

{{ site.name }} will allow you to jump around symbol definitions even across
files with just a click. To "*Jump to Symbol Declaration*" use `Control+Command+Alt+Up`
(or `Alt+Click` on Windows, `Command+Click` on Linux or `Control+Click` on Mac OS X)
over the symbol, and `Control+Command+alt+Left` for going back.

## To use...

Start typing code as usual, autocomplete will pop up whenever it's available. To
trigger manual codeintel autocompletion use `Shift+Control+Space` (`Shift+Command+Space`
on Mac OS X).

**DON'T DESPAIR!** The first time you use it it needs to build some indexes and
it can take more than a few seconds (around six in my configuration).

*It just works!*
