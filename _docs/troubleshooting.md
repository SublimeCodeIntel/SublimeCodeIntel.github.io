If you find problems you can try the following:

* If you upgraded SublimeCodeIntel, please restart Sublime Text.

* Check the `~/.codeintel/codeintel.log` file to see if there are any errors in
  it or in the Sublime Text console.

* Delete the directory with the CodeIntel database `~/.codeintel/db` and restart
  Sublime Text.

* Search through the [GitHub Issues]({{ site.repository }}/issues){:target="_blank"}
  and [file a new issue]({{ site.repository }}/issues/new) when appropriate, but
  please make sure to include your current version of Sublime Text, SublimeCodeIntel and
  Operating System.
